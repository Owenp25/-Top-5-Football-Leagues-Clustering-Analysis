# Top-5-Football-Leagues-Clustering-Analysis

6/26/2023 - For this project my goal is to cluster teams in the top 5 leagues by their passing, goal & shot creation, pass types, possession, and defensive stats to determine teams that are similar in playing style. My initial plan is to do this with a combination of the aforementioned stats to best represent the team’s overall play style: this includes type of ball progression from defense to attack, tempo of play, and most prominent type of shot creation. I plan on using K-means clustering in python to do this. Often in the soccer world we classify teams on a scale somewhere between controlling possession and direct counter attack. I think this project is useful because it can show how these play styles can be quantified and how distinct the groups of tactical approaches are. If there are more distinct clusters, then it is evident that certain general patterns of play are effective across all of Europe’s best leagues. If there is more of a sliding scale of play styles, then we will have insight into how important individual managers’ philosophies are. Looking at contemporary literature, “K-means cluster analysis was also used by Gollan, Ferrar, and Norton [36] to recognize playing styles. Three game style clusters were identified: (1) moderately favoring established defense, (2) dominant in transition offense and transition defense, and (3) strong in established offense and set pieces. The disadvantage of this method is that it does neither recognize playing styles, nor is it capable of quantifying them; instead, it categorizes the teams based on the phases in which they excel” (Plakias S et al., Identifying Soccer Teams’ Styles of Play: A Scoping and Critical Review.) After reading this I still want to proceed with K-means clustering, but I will keep in mind the known downsides. I think my next step would be to use factor analysis to work backwards from individual statistics in an effort to see what overarching play styles there are.
